## Test Log Entry  

**Context:**  
Repository for QuantumTrader AI created.  
Landing page (`index.html`) scaffolded.  

**Notes:**  
- Placeholder logo inserted.  
- Backup file `index.backup.html` created.  
- Early commit strategy established.

step: 2
title: "Reminders System"
status: completed
---

## Test Log Entry  

**Context:**  
Private reminder system introduced (`reminders.log`).  

**Notes:**  
- File created and hidden from public visibility.  
- Commit guide tested (`git add reminders.log && git commit -m "Add reminders log"`).  
- Verified that reminders remain private to dev environment.  

**Next Actions:**  
1. Keep reminders log outside public assets.  
2. Expand functionality later if necessary.

step: 3
title: "Frontend to Backend Integration"
status: in-progress
---

## Test Log Entry  

**Context:**  
We are in **Step 3 of Step 5** of the QuantumTrader AI build process.  
Focus: Connecting `index.html` frontend with `server.js` backend through partial integration.  

**Notes:**  
- Integration tested between frontend (static page) and backend route `/api/visitor-stats`.  
- Script placement confirmed inside `<body>` of `index.html`.  
- Reminder system now functional (via `reminders.log`).  

**Next Actions:**  
1. Expand integration to cover event-driven visitor tracking.  
2. Refine API endpoints for global stats visibility (private).  
3. Document linguistic distinctions (server.js vs index.html instructions).

## [2025-09-19] Talking Drum Integration

- Added Talking Drum (🪘) and Drum (🥁) emojis to the center of the horizontal "Y" symbol.  
- Symbolism:  
  - 🪘 (Gangan) → Ancient Yoruba Talking Drum, now universalized as Quantum Signal of QT AI.  
  - 🥁 (Drum) → Language & Culture, paired with 🪘 for balance.  
- Status: Display confirmed at standard emoji size.
