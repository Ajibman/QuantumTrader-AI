🌹🕊️👉QuantumTrader-AI
Owner-Test / Simulation Edition (Architecture-Frozen)
Status: Owner-Test & Simulation Only
Execution: Disabled by Design
Live Trading: Architecturally Unreachable
Version Line: v1.0.0-owner-test-frozen.

Overview:
QuantumTrader-AI is a safety-first decision-intelligence platform for market analysis, system experimentation, and governance-driven AI research.
This release operates exclusively in Owner-Test and Simulation modes.

It is intentionally designed so that no live trading or capital execution is possible until App Registrar Certification.

QuantumTrader-AI prioritizes:
Explainability
Governance
Risk containment
Auditability
before any notion of live deployment.
What This Release Is
This Owner-Test release is:

✅ A decision-support and analysis system.
✅ A governed AI experimentation platform.
✅ A demonstration of safe system architecture.
✅ Suitable for research, review, and demonstration.
It allows owners and reviewers to:
Explore system behavior safely
Validate permission boundaries
Observe AI signal generation (non-executing)
Evaluate architecture and threat models

What This Release Is NOT
This release is not:

❌ A live trading bot.
❌ An autonomous execution system.
❌ Connected to brokers or exchanges.
❌ Capable of placing real or simulated trades.
❌ A financial product or investment service.
There is no execution path, visible or hidden.

Core Design Principles:
1. Intent ≠ Execution:
Owners may declare intent (modes, nodes, tests),
but no intent directly causes execution.
2. Owner-Governed Control:
A dedicated Owner Console acts as the single authority
All other components are read-only listeners.
No page can escalate privileges independently.
3. Progressive Permissions:
Simulation Mode - Observation only
Owner-Test Mode: Analysis & intelligence only
Live Mode: Architecturally unreachable (hard-blocked)
4. Fail-Closed by Default:
If anything behaves unexpectedly, the system -
Blocks execution.
Logs the event.
Preserves safety.

System Architecture (High Level)
Owner Console:
Central authority for mode selection and node activation.
Listener Pages (TraderLab, TradingFloor, CPilot).
React to owner state but cannot issue authority.

Permission Gates:
Enforce what actions are allowed per mode.
Node Gates.
Bind analytical functions to explicit node activation.

Session Governance:
State persists safely within a session and resets on closure.

Safety & Governance Guarantees:
This release guarantees:
No accidental live trading
No single-click escalation
No silent state mutation
No anonymous authority
No irreversible actions

Every critical decision is:
Observable.
Explainable.
Contained.

 👉Certification Status:
QuantumTrader-AI is currently operating prior to external certification from QonexAI™.

Until certification is granted:
Live execution remains disabled.
No production trading claims are made.
The system remains in Owner-Test / Simulation posture.
Certification is treated as a gate, not a marketing milestone.

👉Intended Audience:
This release is intended for - 
System owners.
Technical reviewers.
Researchers.
Auditors.
Regulators (for inspection).
Investors (for governance evaluation).
It is not intended for retail users or live trading.

Usage Notice:
By using or reviewing this software, you acknowledge that -
It does not execute trades.
It does not provide financial advice.
It is an experimental, governance-focused system.
Any analysis produced is informational only.

Roadmap (High Level):
Maintain Owner-Test stability.
Improve explainability and documentation.
To complete external certification review.
No Live enablement without explicit re-architecture.

Any future execution capability would require:
New version line.
New threat model.
New external approvals.

Final Statement:
QuantumTrader-AI is designed to be safe first, impressive second, and live only when it is provably responsible to do so.

This Owner-Test release represents a complete, frozen, and defensible architecture. The Mode refers to testing performed exclusively by the system owner/architect. No third-party users are involved.
