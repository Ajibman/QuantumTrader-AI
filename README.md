📌 How it works:
sl=auto → auto-detect source language
tl=en → default target language (user can change it)
Users can select any language from the Google Translate UI
You may optionally replace tl=en with:
tl=fr (French)
tl=ar (Arabic)
tl=pt (Portuguese) …but leaving it as en is neutral and safe.

👉 In the event of interpretational differences, the original English version governs. Else change "en" to language of choice.

👉QuantumTrader-AI is now at 
Owner-Test / Simulation Edition (Architecture-Frozen)
QuantumTrader-AI is the App. Quantum-origin neural exchange ai (Qonexeai is the network.
Current Status: Owner-Test & Simulation Only
Execution: Disabled by Design
Live Trading: Architecturally Unreachable
Version Line: v1.0.0-owner-test-frozen.

Overview:
QuantumTrader-AI is a safety-first decision-intelligence platform for market analysis, system experimentation, and governance-driven AI research.
This release operates exclusively in Owner-Test and Simulation modes.

It is intentionally designed so that no live trading or capital execution is possible until App Registrar Certification.

QuantumTrader-AI prioritizes:
Explainability
Governance
Risk containment
Loss aversion 
Auditability
before any notion of live deployment.
What This Release Is
This Owner-Test release is:

✅A decision-support and analysis system.

✅ A governed AI experimentation platform.

✅ A demonstration of safe system architecture.

✅ Suitable for research,
review and demonstration.

It allows owners and reviewers to:
Explore system behavior safely
Validate permission boundaries
Observe AI signal generation (non-executing)
Evaluate architecture and threat models

What This Release Is NOT
This release is not:

❌ A live trading bot.

❌ An autonomous execution system.

❌ Connected to brokers or exchanges.

❌ Capable of placing real or simulated trades.

❌ A financial product or investment service.
There is no execution path, visible or hidden.

Core Design Principles:
1. Intent ≠ Execution:
Owners may declare intent (modes, nodes, tests),
but no intent directly causes execution.
2. Owner-Governed Control:
A dedicated Owner Console acts as the single authority
All other components are read-only listeners.
No page can escalate privileges independently.
3. Progressive Permissions:
Simulation Mode - Observation only
Owner-Test Mode: Analysis & intelligence only
Live Mode: Architecturally unreachable (hard-blocked)
4. Fail-Closed by Default:
If anything behaves unexpectedly, the system -
Blocks execution.
Logs the event.
Preserves safety.

System Architecture (High Level)
Owner Console:
Central authority for mode selection and node activation.
Listener Pages (TraderLab, TradingFloor, CPilot).
React to owner state but cannot issue authority.

Permission Gates:
Enforce what actions are allowed per mode.
Node Gates.
Bind analytical functions to explicit node activation.

Session Governance:
State persists safely within a session and resets on closure.

Safety & Governance Guarantees:
This release guarantees:
No accidental live trading
No single-click escalation
No silent state mutation
No anonymous authority
No irreversible actions

Every critical decision is:
Observable.
Explainable.
Contained.
If you have invested any amount during test mode, be rest assured that it is still intact. We know payments are possible.

 👉Certification Status:
QuantumTrader-AI is currently operating prior to external certification from QonexAI in a 60 day Registrar window.

Until certification is granted:
Live execution remains disabled.
No production trading claims are made.
The system remains in Owner-Test / Simulation posture.
Certification is treated as a gate, not a marketing milestone.

👉Intended Audience:
This release is intended for - 
System owners.
Technical reviewers.
Researchers.
Auditors.
Regulators (for inspection).
Investors (for governance evaluation).
It is not intended for retail users or live trading.

Usage Notice:
By using or reviewing this software, you acknowledge that -
It does not execute trades.
It does not provide financial advice.
It is an experimental, governance-focused system.
Any analysis produced is informational only.

Roadmap (High Level):
Maintain Owner-Test stability.
Improve explainability and documentation.
To complete external certification review.
No Live enablement without explicit re-architecture.

Any future execution capability would require:
New version line.
New threat model.
New external approvals.

Final Statement:
QuantumTrader-AI is designed to be safe first, impressive second, and live only when it is provably responsible to do so.

This Owner-Test release represents a complete, frozen, and defensible architecture. The Mode refers to testing performed exclusively by the system owner/visioner/architect/builder/strategist. No third-party users are involved.

👉 Post-Certification Access & Public Posture
QuantumTrader-AI is designed to be globally accessible for understanding and responsibly governed for operation.

👉Public Access (Always Open)
The system remains publicly inspectable
Architecture, design principles, and safety posture are transparent
No onboarding or execution is enabled in public contexts
This ensures openness, learning, and trust without exposing risk.


👉Operational Use (Governed)
Operational use follows explicit governance standards
Access is based on readiness, accountability, and compliance

👉Authority is granted in controlled, auditable environments. This approach prioritizes safety, explainability, and responsibility over indiscriminate access.

👉Global Inclusion Without Compromise:
QuantumTrader-AI welcomes global inspection, research and dialogue.

👉Operational discipline exists to protect users, markets and the integrity of the system—not to exclude participation.

👉Transparency is universal. Authority is governed.

👉Certification Context:
Following certification under the QonexAI™ framework, this posture ensures that QuantumTrader-AI scales responsibly without compromising safety or trust. QonexAI is a quantum origin neural artificial intelligence network.

👉Trust is earned and Safety is no compromise.

👉If a NT member invite a user, you automatically become a guarantor and mentor.

👉🧬 Doctrine–Software Binding Statement
In QuantumTrader-AI, every technical node corresponds to a human responsibility.
No logic executes without accountability. No access exists without mentorship.
This binds:
Cognitive Nodes ↔ Human Guarantors
Access Rights ↔ Ethical Responsibility
Growth ↔ Traceability
🪡 The Threaded Needle, Restated as System Law
A threaded needle is never gone missing.
In system terms:
No anonymous actors
No orphan intelligence
No unmanaged scale
Every participant is introduced, guided, and answerable—not surveilled, not excluded, but held within the fabric of the system.

Formal Annex / Footnote (Certification & Governance)
👉Annex A: PEACE INDEX 
— Disclosure Status During Registrar Certification Waiting Window
During the active 60-day Registrar Certification Waiting Window, no public statements, documentation, or representations have been issued concerning the Peace Index or any potential relationship to the platform.
This non-disclosure posture is maintained in strict compliance with certification requirements, governance safeguards, and responsible information-release protocols. Any future disclosure, reference, or integration related to the Peace Index shall be contingent upon the successful completion of certification procedures and subsequent authorization through formally approved governance and compliance mechanisms.

👉Donor Due-Diligence Disclosure Note - 
At the time of this submission, QuantumTrader-AI has not made any public disclosures regarding the Peace Index or its relevance to the platform.
This posture reflects a precautionary, compliance-first approach during the active 60-day Registrar Certification Waiting Window. The project maintains a clear separation between certification processes and any prospective conceptual, analytical, or policy frameworks in order to preserve governance integrity, ensure donor confidence, and remain aligned with internationally accepted disclosure and accountability standards. Any future communication on this subject will be considered only upon completion of certification and following formal governance approval.
