# CPilot‚Ñ¢ ‚Äî Quantum Trader AI Commercial Pilot

CPilot‚Ñ¢ (Commercial Pilot) is the **autonomous trading engine** of the Quantum Trader AI project.  
It manages trading sessions across multiple timeframes, with the initial **30-second cycle** prepared as the foundation.

---

## Status
üö¶ **Dormant until November 09, 2025**

- CPilot.py exists in **skeleton form**.
- All logic is placeholder/dummy until activation.
- November 09, 2025 ‚Üí full trading logic goes live.

---

## Session Cycle
CPilot sessions can be launched in different durations:

- **30s** ‚Üí default and initial test cycle  
- **60s, 5m, 10m, 15m, 20m**  
- **24h, 48h, 72h**  

> Currently only **30s cycle** is in the skeleton.

---

## Mission
CPilot is designed to:
- Operate securely within Quantum Trader AI (QT AI).
- Trade with **discipline, patience, and integrity**.
- Support the **traceable currency of peace** that underpins QT AI‚Äôs vision.

---

## Next Steps
- Wire up the trading core after November 09, 2025.
- Connect to `TraderLab` modules for strategy execution.
- Synchronize with CCLM¬≤‚Ñ¢ supervision layer.

---

**Note:** CPilot is part of the *TraderLab* but is not yet ready. It will remain dormant until the official rollout date.
