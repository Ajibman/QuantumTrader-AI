QONEXAI SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
Version: 1.0.0 | Last Updated: {{TODAY'S DATE}}*

ðŸ”§ Core Structure

QonexAI is built as a modular AI framework with 15 interlinked logic layers, each fulfilling a distinct cognitive, governance, or system integration role. The design aligns with quantum-influenced computation and nanotech scalability principles.

ðŸ§© Module Layers

| Module | Name                                   | Role |
|--------|----------------------------------------|------|
| 01     | Observation Intelligence Layer         | Real-time input capture + preprocessing |
| 02     | Data Parsing & Signal Amplification    | Signal validation + formatting |
| 03     | Core Semantic Processor                | Language, logic, and pattern matching |
| 04     | Memory Contextualization Engine        | Short & long-term context recall |
| 05     | Ethical Reasoning Matrix               | Compliance and integrity scan |
| 06     | Adaptive Learning Core                 | Pattern reinforcement, realignment |
| 07     | Intent Recognition System              | Goal detection and task priming |
Modules 12 â†’ 13 â†’ 14 create a *governance + feedback bridge* to dynamically validate, flag anomalies, and loop corrections upstream.

ðŸ§  Nanotech & Lethbridge Inspiration

Modules 14â€“15 simulate nano-scale synchronization using a "Lethbridge handshake" â€” symbolizing ultra-precise alignment before final deployment or API exposure.
